### Lesson 3 - Basic Time Series Patterns in Finance

**Notebook**:<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/freestackinitiative/time_series_for_finance/blob/main/finance_timeseries_analysis/Lesson%203_%20Basic%20Time%20Series%20Patterns%20in%20Finance.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

**Overview**: The intricate dance of financial data reveals various patterns. Recognizing these patterns is akin to understanding a language. In this lesson, we'll introduce you to three main patterns frequently seen in time series financial data and how to visualize them using Python.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Time Series Patterns: Familiarize yourself with the triad:
- Trend: A long-term movement in data, either upward or downward.
- Seasonality: Consistent, predictable variations in a series at specific intervals.
- Cycles: Irregular fluctuations tied to business or economic scenarios, differing from the regularity of seasonality.
- Python Visualization: A hands-on example displayed a synthetic stock price trajectory, showcasing trend and cyclical behaviors. Annotations in the graph - further illuminate these patterns.

### Lesson 4 - Time Series Decomposition

**Notebook**: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/freestackinitiative/time_series_for_finance/blob/main/finance_timeseries_analysis/Lesson%204_%20Time%20Series%20Decomposition.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

**Overview**: Navigating the intricate layers of financial data, this lesson's focus lies in time series decomposition. Just as we might dissect a clock to understand its mechanics, we split a time series into its primary elements, allowing us to decipher each component's role and influence.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Understanding Decomposition: Time series decomposition divides a series into:
- Trend: The long-term movement.
- Seasonal: Regular fluctuations or patterns.
- Residual: The 'noise' or unpredictable variations.
- Python in Action: Leveraging Python's `statsmodels` library, we demonstrated how to untangle a synthetic stock price series into its core parts. The visualization lets us see and interpret the trend, seasonal, and residual components separately, offering a richer understanding of the data.

### Lesson 5 - Moving Averages and Smoothing

**Notebook**: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/freestackinitiative/time_series_for_finance/blob/main/finance_timeseries_analysis/Lesson%205_%20Moving%20Averages%20and%20Smoothing.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

**Overview**: As we progress through our financial journey, this lesson uncovers the art of moving averages. An essential technique, moving averages act as a sieve, filtering out short-term noise and revealing the genuine trend of our data.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Utility of Moving Averages: Like ironing out wrinkles, moving averages iron out the fluctuations, offering a smoother representation. This smoother line can often highlight more accurate trends and patterns within the data.
- SMA vs. EMA: Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a straightforward average over a set period, giving each data point equal weight. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) places more emphasis on recent data, providing a faster reaction to recent price changes.
- Python Application: Using Python, we delved into a practical visualization. By plotting the original data alongside its SMA and EMA, we can more clearly discern the differences and the insights each brings.

### Lesson 6 - Autocorrelation and Its Significance

**Notebook**: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/freestackinitiative/time_series_for_finance/blob/main/finance_timeseries_analysis/Lesson%206_%20Autocorrelation%20and%20Its%20Significance.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

**Overview**: This lesson unravels the intricacies of autocorrelation, a powerful diagnostic tool for analyzing time series data. A measure of internal correlation, autocorrelation brings out hidden relationships within sequential data, allowing us to better understand and predict its behavior.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Defining Autocorrelation: Think of autocorrelation as a mirror. Just as a mirror reflects our image, autocorrelation reflects how a series correlates with its own past values.
- Relevance in Finance: Autocorrelation holds considerable importance in financial time series:
- Spotting Trends & Seasonality: Autocorrelation can indicate repetitive patterns or lingering momentum in data.
- Modeling Decisions: Some forecasting models necessitate non-autocorrelated data, making this a vital diagnostic tool.
- Market Efficiency: Strong autocorrelation might hint at market inefficiencies, providing avenues for trading strategies.
- Python's Prowess: With Python's `statsmodels` library, visualizing autocorrelation becomes a breeze. The plotted graph aids in intuitively grasping the data's self-correlation over different lags.

### Lesson 7 - Stationarity in Time Series

**Notebook**: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/freestackinitiative/time_series_for_finance/blob/main/finance_timeseries_analysis/Lesson%207_%20Stationarity%20in%20Time%20Series.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

**Overview**: Stationarity is to time series what stability is to a ship. Just as a stable ship ensures a smooth sail, a stationary time series ensures robust forecasting. In this lesson, we embark on understanding why stationarity is the linchpin of effective time series analysis.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Stationarity Unveiled: At its heart, a stationary time series remains unaltered in its statistical attributes - mean, variance, and autocorrelation - irrespective of the time at which you observe it.
- The Imperative of Stationarity:
- Foundation for Forecasting: Stationary data acts as fertile ground for predictability since its inherent properties don't oscillate over time.
- Avoiding Misleading Models: Many forecasting models are built on the bedrock of stationarity. Using them on non-stationary data is like fitting a square peg in a round hole - inaccurate and misleading.
- Stability in Attributes: With stationarity, you get what you see - the attributes like mean and variance are consistent, eliminating the guesswork.
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test: The ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test is a litmus test for stationarity. A low p-value flags stationary data, setting the stage for subsequent analysis.

### Lesson 8 - Forecasting with ARIMA Models

**Notebook**: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/freestackinitiative/time_series_for_finance/blob/main/finance_timeseries_analysis/Lesson%208_%20Forecasting%20with%20ARIMA%20Models.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

**Overview**: ARIMA, the Swiss army knife of time series forecasting! As we venture further into forecasting's fascinating realm, ARIMA stands as a testament to the synthesis of three powerful components, offering us a robust model to predict future trends.

**Key Takeaways**:

*ARIMA Decoded*

- AR (AutoRegressive): Like looking in the rear-view mirror, AR uses past values to predict the future.
- I (Integrated): By differencing, this component makes our series stationary, setting the stage for accurate forecasting.
- MA (Moving Average): It focuses on the relationship between an observation and the residual errors from prior predictions, acting like a corrective lens.

*ARIMA’s Virtues*

- Versatility: With its three components, ARIMA can adapt to various temporal structures in time series data.
- Historical Context: By integrating past observations, it captures the essence of historical data patterns.
- ARIMA in Action with Python: The given Python code succinctly showcases how ARIMA can be harnessed to forecast future stock prices, painting a comparative picture between past data and future predictions.
