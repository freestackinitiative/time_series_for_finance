As we progress deeper into the intricacies of time series analysis, understanding stationarity becomes paramount. A foundational concept, stationarity can make or break our forecasting models."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## What is Stationarity?\n","\n","A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, remain constant over time. Most forecasting techniques assume that the time series is stationary, making it a critical aspect to verify.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Why is Stationarity Crucial?\n","\n","1. **Predictability**: Stationary processes are easier to predict, as their properties don't change over time.\n","2. **Model Assumptions**: Many time series models assume stationarity. Non-stationary data can lead to unreliable and spurious results.\n","3. **Consistent Properties**: The mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure do not change over time for stationary data.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Checking Stationarity with Python\n","\n","The `ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test` is a popular method to check for stationarity.
