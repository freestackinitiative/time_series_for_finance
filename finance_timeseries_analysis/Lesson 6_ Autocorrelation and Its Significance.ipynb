Today's journey into the world of time series analysis introduces us to the concept of autocorrelation. A crucial tool in our analytical arsenal, autocorrelation helps us discern patterns and relationships within our data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## What is Autocorrelation?\n","\n","Autocorrelation, or serial correlation, measures the relationship between a variable's current value and its past values. In finance, it can hint at momentum or other trends in stock prices or market returns."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Why is Autocorrelation Important in Time Series Analysis?\n","\n","Identifying autocorrelation can:\n","\n","1. Indicate the presence of trends or seasonality.\n","2. Inform model selection, as some forecasting models require the absence of autocorrelation.\n","3. Highlight inefficiencies in financial markets, potentially leading to trading strategies."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Visualizing Autocorrelation with Python\n","\n","Python's `statsmodels` library provides tools to plot and analyze autocorrelation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"nE0L-CbyEkG5"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf\n","\n","# Sample data (use real financial data for deeper insights)\n","dates = pd.date_range(start=\"2019-01-01\", end=\"2021-12-31\", freq=\"D\")\n","stock_returns = [np.random.randn() for _ in range(len(dates))]\n","\n","# Plot autocorrelation\n","plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n","plot_acf(stock_returns, lags=30)\n","plt.title('Autocorrelation of Stock Returns')\n","plt.xlabel('Lag')\n","plt.ylabel('Autocorrelation')\n","plt.tight_layout()\n","plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### What is going on?\n","\n","1. **Sample Data Creation**: We've generated synthetic stock returns using random values.\n","2. **Autocorrelation Plotting**: The `plot_acf` function is used to visualize the autocorrelation for up to 30 lags."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Lesson Summary\n","\n","Today, we've delved deep into autocorrelation, revealing its power in discerning relationships within time series data.
